#A test

<p>Talked with Bowen who is working on FB+Yelp-like startup full-time. He is very confident and talkative.  </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">His startup</h2>

<p>Bowen's startup was about finding the best food by the recommendation of similar people - friends or people from the same home country. His biggest challen</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">CopyCat Problems</h2>

<p>He said the best VC looks for personality, and they look for strength in the founding team. A so-so team is not acceptable. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Founder traits</h2>

<p>I failed to answer his question about where I am entirely unique. But he know I am unique because during the orientation day I am the only Chinese that talked with everyone.Alice replied that I have the initiative and could persist. She told me that I got the power to do bigger things, but right now I just like a lion playing with wool ball like a cat. Maybe I indeed lack the confidence and start losing my inner power during this long vacation.</p>

<p>Although many tech founders are introverts by themselves, it is always worth to practice speaking with confident and fluency, just like Bowen. When I meet Hang Song later this month, I'll try to learn that by imitate Bowen. Good luck to myself </p>

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
