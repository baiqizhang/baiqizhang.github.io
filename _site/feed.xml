&amp;gt; New research suggests that employees with a diverse Twitter network — one that exposes them to people and ideas they don’t already know — tend to generate better ideas.
&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seldom use twitter before, nor their Chinese counterpart(Sina Microblog). As a very technical person, I cared more about top papers or hottest open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed to answer his question about where I am entirely unique. But he know I am unique because during the orientation day I am the only Chinese that talked with everyone.Alice replied that I have the initiative and could persist. She told me that I got the power to do bigger things, but right now I just like a lion playing with wool ball like a cat. Maybe I indeed lack the confidence and start losing my inner power during this long vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many tech founders are introverts by themselves, it is always worth to practice speaking with confident and fluency, just like Bowen. When I meet Hang Song later this month, I&#39;ll try to learn that by imitate Bowen. Good luck to myself &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seldom use twitter before, nor their Chinese counterpart(Sina Microblog). As a very technical person, I cared more about top papers or hottest open-source projects. This is no more since I read this enlightening report from MIT Slogan Management Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of this report is that according to some research on company innovation using graph analysis, company staff with bigger and more diverse Twitter network tend to create higher value ideas for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
